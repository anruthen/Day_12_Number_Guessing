# Day 12 â€“ Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

This project implements a number guessing game where the user plays against the computer. The user selects a difficulty level and tries to guess the randomly selected number within the given attempts.

## Features

- Console-based game with clear prompts
- Two difficulty levels: easy (10 attempts), hard (5 attempts)
- Random number between 1 and 100
- Feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low
- Game ends when the number is guessed or attempts run out

## How It Works

- The game picks a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player chooses the difficulty level.
- The player enters guesses one at a time.
- After each guess, feedback is given: too high, too low, or correct.
- The game ends with a win or loss message.

## Example Output
```
